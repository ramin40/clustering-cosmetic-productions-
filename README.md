# clustering-cosmetic-productions-
- clustering cosmetic productions according to their components in several groups.
- Whenever you want to try a new cosmetic item, it's so difficult to choose. It's actually more than difficult. It's sometimes scary because new items that you've never tried end up giving you skin trouble.  I'm going to create a content-based recommendation system where the 'content' will be the chemical components of cosmetics. Specifically, I will process ingredient lists for 1472 cosmetics on Sephora via word embedding, then visualize ingredient similarity using a machine learning method called t-SNE and an interactive visualization library called Bokeh.
- main idea from datacamp.
